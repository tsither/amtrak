## Getting started

### Prerequisites

In accordance with the Flatland competition, it is recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and create a new conda environment:
```
conda create python=3.8 --name amtrak
conda activate amtrak
```

üì¶ Then, install requirements, including the stable release of Flatland:
```
pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
```

üì¶ To have access to clingo, install the required package:
```
conda install -c conda-forge clingo
# or if that doesn't work:
# conda install -c potassco clingo


## Project Structure

Our project includes three different implementations:

- `base_solution.lp` : our initial solution where movement is on a cell by cell basis ()
- `graph_based_TODO.lp` : TODO
- `station_stops_solution.lp` : our base solution adapted to accomodate station stop along along a train's journey


### base_solution and graph_based_TODO - Solver

To run either the base_solution or graph_based_TODO implementations, uncomment the appropriate line in asp/params.py and run the solver as normal:

```
TODO: fill in with params
primary = ['amtrak/base_solution.lp', 'amtrak/track_options.lp']
secondary = []

```

The `primary` parameter is necessary, and is the standard suite of path planning encodings that return the appropriate `action(...)` output.  The `secondary` parameter is optional, and is primarily used when malfunctions are present in an environment.  Developers may choose to create a set of secondary encodings that help the replanning process necessary when faced with a train that has stalled.  For instance, it may be more efficient to consider the existing plan than to replan from the start.  More information about this is available in the üìÅ `doc` folder.  If malfunctions are active and no `secondary` encoding is provided, the tooltik will call the `primary` set of encodings.

From the command line, call `python solve.py` along with a path to the `.pkl` form of the environment to test on, for example:
```
python solve.py envs/pkl/test.pkl
```

If successful, the output will be saved as a `.gif` (which by the way is pronounced [/d í…™f/](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-10/is-it-pronounced-gif-or-jif/10102374) according to the creator of the format) animation, as well as a log file that details at each step what occurred in the simulation.
